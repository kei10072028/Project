<h4>Financing Policies</h4>
<p>At Usagi Mountain Bike Park, we understand that purchasing a mountain bike and equipment can be a significant investment. That's why we offer flexible financing options to make it easier for you to get the gear you need to enjoy the adventure. Our goal is to help you get on the trails without the burden of upfront costs.</p>

<p>Our Financing Options Include:</p>

<p>0% Interest Financing: For qualified buyers, we offer 6, 12, or 18-month interest-free payment plans. This way, you can split your payments and enjoy your bike today without the worry of high interest rates.</p>
<p>Flexible Payment Terms: Choose the payment schedule that works best for you—weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.</p>
<p>Easy Approval Process: Our quick and simple application process can be done in-store or online, and you’ll get an instant approval decision.</p>
<p>No Hidden Fees: Our financing options are transparent, so you won’t encounter any hidden fees. The price you see is the price you pay, divided into manageable payments.</p>
<p>How to Apply:</p>

<p>Visit our shop or contact us online to apply for financing.</p>
<p>Provide the required information, such as proof of income, and choose your preferred payment plan.</p>
<p>Once approved, you’ll be able to take your bike and gear home the same day or get your order delivered to your home.</p>
